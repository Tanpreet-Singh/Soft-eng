The project uses spectrometry to analyze different chemicals. The spectrum is obtained through NMR an deconvolution is used to filter the data to be able to identify specific chemical structures.
The software needs to be updated to be able to analyze multi-charged molecules. These molecules have multiple charges on different sides depending on its structure.

Languages & Libraries Used: Python, Kiwi, LMFit

Meeting with Sponsors:
	Ask questions (probe them).
	Ask to record them.
	Batch questions, Product Owners will typically be the bridge of communication between the sponsors and the team.
	What deconvolution algorithms do they use? How is it implemented in their existing project?
	What kind of calculations are involved with analyzing multiple-charged ions?
